# The best native dada2 taxonomy assignment seems to be to run the 
# naive Bayesian classifier to species level and independently run 
# exact species matching. The two separate estiamtes can then be 
# cross-validated to get the most complete ASV table. When only
# one approach yields species, that species is accepted. Similarly,
# when both appraoches agree, there is no conflict. However,
# when both approaches yield different species, the choice is made 
# according to these rules:
# 1. If genus and/or species clash, exact matching is trusted
#    over naive Bayesian classification.
# 2. If genus aligns and exact matching identifies several species
#    including the one identified by naive Bayesian classification
#    the single species identified by the latter method is trusted.
# 3. If none of the species identified by exact matching match the
#    species identified by naive Bayesian classification, the list 
#    of species is favoured over the single species.
